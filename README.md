# Subnet Analysis & Visualization

> DevOps internship task

## About This Project

This repository was part of a hands-on internship task focused on subnet analysis and Docker containerization. The goal? Build a tool that could:
- Analyze IP subnets and calculate usable hosts
- Generate clear, shareable reports across formats (CSV, JSON, XLSX)
- Visualize network distributions with Matplotlib
- Wrap the logic into a Docker container for scalable deployment

### ðŸ“˜ What I Learned

- **Subnet analysis** turned out to be more insightful than expected. Understanding how IP ranges are calculated and allocated revealed the practical depth behind something I previously viewed as abstract.
- **Pythonâ€™s `ipaddress` module** turned out to be a hidden gem. It made network slicing feel effortless, and clarified concepts I had only seen in theory.
- **Matplotlib** deepened my appreciation for the role of design in data presentation. A single color or axis label can dramatically shift how insights are interpreted.
- **Docker** reshaped my approach to packaging. Transforming a simple script into a deployable service showed me what real-world scalability looks like.

## Folder Breakdown

- `/Visualize.py` â†’ plots subnet sizes in a bar chart
- `/Report/report.md` â†’ written summary of the analysis
- `/group_sizes.csv` â†’ raw output of subnet sizing
- `/network_plot.png` â†’ visual representation of subnet distribution
- `/README.md` â†’ youâ€™re reading it right now
